To create unit tests:
1. "import unittest" at the top of the file
2. Create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase like
"class TestHandChecker(unittest.TestCase):"
3. Create methods that assertEquals()/True()/False(), etc. These are the test cases
4. Add the line below:
    "if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()"

To run unit tests:
1. Open a terminal to the poker_engine directory
2. Run "python -m unittest tests.<test_file_name>"
3. The command line outputs the number of tests passed and the number failed/went to error.

For more info, look at the unittest module documentation
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

You can also take a look at hand_checker_tests.py, which is working.
